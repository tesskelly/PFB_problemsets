Tess by Shel Silverstein

Tess loves me,
Tess cares,
Tess picks me peaches and pears.
Tess offers me candy and Cokes,
Tess listens and laughs at me jokes.
Tess helps when I get in a fight,
Tess does all my homework at night.
Tess misses me,
Tess cries,
Tess thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Tess is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Tess just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Tess's hand,
In the darkness where Tess usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Tess's gone!
